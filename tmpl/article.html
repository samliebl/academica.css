            <h1>Philip Agre on the Internet</h1>
            <p class="lede">Some generally dark and humorless notes about the decline of Internet hype, the obsolescence of amazon.com, the impeachment mess, the devolution of operating systems, the benefits of sociology, and the last word in bad movies, plus a few URL’s.</p>
            <p>As a periodic reminder, either of the Web-based archives of past RRE messages going back five-plus years can be searched by keyword. Details on the RRE web page<sup>†</sup>: That page will also remind you, if you’re curious, how to unsubscribe. First a few comments about the list itself and about the larger themes of Internet culture that it reflects.</p>
            <h2>Whether I sleep</h2>
            <p>People keep asking me if I sleep,<sup>11</sup> and the answer is that I sleep fine. Although many people evidently perceive this list as the result of superhuman effort, it’s<sup>n</sup> really not so. I cringe at attempts, however well-meaning, to inflate my contribution, because my point here is not my own self but rather the medium and its possibilities<sup><em>f</em></sup> for promoting positive values in the world. The Internet is my force multiplier, and I can broadcast<sub><em>44, g</em></sub> so much useful data because I’ve been exploring simple ways to cultivate and amplify the gift economy. Where do I get all of my dozens of useful URL’s? People send them to me! How about the long lists of books?<sup>2, fn</sup> They emerge from a simple technology consisting of bookstore shelves, bibliographies, 3-by-5 cards, online catalogs,<sub>13</sub> the copy-and-paste function of the Macintosh, and of course Emacs<sub>fk</sub> keyboard macros. A few minutes a day suffice.</p>
            <p>In general, my strategy is to do whatever I feel like doing. The people of California in their considerable wisdom have determined that society benefits if space is carved out for a limited number of people who have passed through several extremely competitive hurdles to be cut that kind of slack. If I felt like doing drugs or having an ambitious social life then I wouldn’t have gotten where I am now. So I do what I feel like doing, and I do as little else as I can, and over time the things I feel like doing have coalesced into comfortable daily routines that make some kind of positive contribution to the world. The world is full of virtuous plans that I’ll never be able to execute without dragging myself around like a bag of rocks.</p>
            <h4>So I just forget those plans</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Confident that by scratching in my notebook
                    <ol>
                        <li>for a while I’ll come up with equally
                            <ol>
                                <li>an virtuous plan that I can’t help executing
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>and that if truly virtuous will become

            <p>Some people, so they say, subscribe to this list primarily for my opinions. Other people hate my opinions and subscribe for the stuff that I forward from other people. But even for these latter people, who in some sense would prefer that I just shut up, my voice still seems to make a difference. If I did shut up, the list would become impersonal. Someone actually said this after Paul Duguid took over the list for a while. Paul was so busy fighting unforeseen technical fires that he didn’t have time amid his busy life to put his personal stamp on the list, and this other subscriber said that it was like a machine was sending stuff that everyone received in an alienated way without any human relationship involved. I don’t blame Paul for this. He did a great job, and his voice was certainly present in the stuff he chose to send out, just as the list expresses my own voice whether I interject my own comments or not. Yet somehow that other voice, the voice of selection and timing, is not so audible without the commentary. This is one intuition behind the frivolous aspects of the list, like my reviews of cheap pens. It’s fun to review these pens, and to have people send me pens, and to imagine that someone out there is thinking about the list every time they list their groceries, and such reasons would probably be reason enough to keep me typing my reviews. But the pen reviews and other small rituals also serve a bigger purpose of helping to confer a personality on the list, so that everyone can feel as though the individual messages all hang together, in a sense, as one big message.</p>
            <p>I keep wanting to initiate an RRE feature called something like “Ask the Red Rock Eater,” or “Ask Phil.” People would send me questions, and if I like the questions I would dash off a page, or five pages, expounding my own opinion about them. I never actually do it because it seems too self-centered. This isn’t supposed to be about me.</p>
            <p>But then another part of me sees that a charlatan like Camille Paglia gets her own “Ask Camille” department of a serious magazine (Salon, as it happens), and gets mad. After all, I’m not exactly disguising my opinions here. I want to have a public voice, which seems like a socially useful thing to want, without aspiring or pretending to be a celebrity, which very idea makes my flesh crawl. It’s an impasse. Some people said that the Eric Paulos’ “I-Bomb” message about the spark-gap generator that creates Technology-Free Zones seemed bogus. It helps if you know that Eric is a member of Survival Research Laboratories. These are the artists who build giant robotic dinosaurs that engage in apocalyptic battles in parking lots. The “I-Bomb” message is patterned on SRL’s nihilistic mock manifestos. Besides, what’s so hard about building a big spark gap?</p>
            <h3>Moving on…</h3>
            <p>Sometime in the fourth quarter of 1998, it seems, cyber hype went out of fashion. Nicholas Negroponte wound up his column at Wired, for example, declaring that the digital revolution was over and that the whole subject had become boring. Now, therefore, we can start the hard process of looking back over the cultural typhoon of the last five years and asking ourselves, “what in the heck was that?.” It was, for one thing, as I’ve said here before, the great sucking sound of a standard-issue millennialism being pulled into the imaginative vacuum created by a new technology. Maybe it was fun while it lasted, but in historical terms it was the same old stuff. It was also, for another thing, ideology pure and simple. Prophets informed us that the new technology would inevitably, and solely on its own power, put an end to monopolies and institute a decentralized society. We as citizens didn’t have to do anything about it, and we definitely didn’t have to go mixing any democracy into it. Now that the Internet industry has consolidated into a handful of monopolies run by obnoxious moguls, and now that competition in this industry has been reduced to border wars and the leveraging of standards and rents, the ideologists can now declare victory and go home. Some of them still write to me to explain why Microsoft isn’t really a monopoly, but most of them don’t even bother. They’re off doing something more profitable.</p>
            <p>Who collaborated in the storm of hype? Blame, it seems to me, should not be evenly distributed. On average, and I realize that this is not a common view, I think that most reporters had serious intentions. Newspapers generally did a good job. The New York Times would top the list for the sheer magnitude of its coverage, and in fact it has had easily two dozen serious people writing on the subject. Some of them have deservedly become semi-celebrities, but I want particularly to pick out Edmund Andrews, who has mostly moved on to other topics but has not received full credit for his reporting on telecommunications politics.</p>
            <p>Academia, however, has a lot to answer for. Lots of people in the arts and humanities, and some sociologists, swallowed the virtual reality and cyberspace shticks whole. The best ones transcended the limitations of the ideology and found more critical, less intuitive, more difficult things to say. I think everyone knows who they are. Many professors of computer science spread technological determinism throughout the world as a routinized language of fund-raising, but some of them, especially in user interface design, stepped honorably out of line and took a stand for socially responsible computing. The important thing is to move forward. I will advocate amnesty, of course, since everyone has a right to promote whatever nonsense they like. But first I would like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to finish its work of documenting the many destructive effects of the cyberspace ideology. And that work has hardly begun.</p>
            <h5>What happens now? Things change gear.</h5>
            <p>The Internet was able to explode because of…</p>
            <ol>
                <li>the government, which was foresighted enough to coordinate the design of open and parsimonious standards,</li>
                <li>one monopoly, AT&T, which was competent enough to build a robust PSTN and shortsighted enough not to embrace and extend the Internet when it had the chance, and</li>
                <li>another monopoly, IBM, which was shortsighted enough not to see the personal computer coming until it was too late to institute a proprietary architecture, and powerful enough to establish a dominant open architecture once it woke up.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Together these concentrations of democratically regulated power made a nice comfortable niche within which the Internet could take off<span class="emdash"></span>a niche so comfortable, in fact, that the firms who benefitted from the explosion could delude themselves into thinking that they were doing it all themselves.
            </p>
            <h6>That niche is now full</h6>
            <p>The Internet will now grow, not by filling a cleanly defined space, but by integrating itself with the technologies and institutions at the edges of that space. That’s a process with completely different dynamics<span class="emdash"></span>different speeds, different players, and an entirely different kind of politics.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>More explosive network businesses like Ebay will probably happen, but they will not be the norm. In fact they’re not the norm now. Those who have worn out a generation of slides extrapolating current penetration rates into the foreseeable future will probably need to get some new slides. The number of IP hosts will probably continue its exponential climb, but the drivers of this climb will change and multiply. The ISOC slogan, “IP on everything, everything on IP,” is actually probably correct, and this should provide plenty of information with which to predict the future of many areas of life.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>But as some of the early failures in the “information appliance” market space demonstrate, predicting the future will also require more sophisticated models for picking and defining the niches within which the growth of IP-based technologies will occur, and in what order, and at what rate. The Internet really will play a big part in transforming the economy, but in a thousand diverse ways that will resist generalization, and not in one big way. The only experts will be the ones on the ground, where the stuff is happening. Everyone else, the erstwhile thought leaders of a simpler world, will find another line of work.</p>
            <h4>I don’t understand how amazon.com is viable.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Barnes and Noble has it in a strategic hammerlock.</li>
                <li>Barnes and Noble can use the profits fromits physical bookstores to subsidize its online operation, and it owns more of the distribution chain.</li>
                <li>Amazon.com simply doesn’t have the scale to compete on distribution, and indeed it is struggling to escape from a dangerous dependence on Barnes and Noble for its books.</li>
                <li>It is true that amazon.com’s Web site is more highly evolved, and if only for that reason it would be a real shame if Barnes and Noble won out.</li>
                <li>It is also true that Barnes and Noble’s physical stores are not well run, and that some of them are unable to compete with those few independent booksellers who have stopped crying about the chains long enough to get some real software for tracking their inventories and targeting their stock to their local markets.</li>
                <li>Still, Barnes and Noble has higher gross margins than amazon.com, and amazon.com’s claims that its own losses are simply due to brand-building advertising expenses are disingenuous.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ni">Has always planned on being there for everything.</p>
            <p>Surely amazon.com has always planned on being bought out; the obvious buyer would be Borders. But Borders seems uninterested in the online market, preferring the more dangerous strategy of expanding overseas. This may explain amazon.com’s recent expansion into other areas of online retail. These other markets (CD’s for example) promise even lower margins than books, since the barriers to entry are lower. But facing its structural impasse, amazon.com has to enter these areas anyway, just maintain the image of momentum that keeps its stock price<span class="emdash"></span>the only supply of capital that can pay for its losses<span class="emdash"></span>propped up. The only way that amazon.com can get out of its current fix is to change the structural situation. And that won’t be easy. It can’t go on double-handling books that come through someone else’s warehouse, since that’s no way to compete with Barnes and Noble. And it can’t operate its own distribution system because it doesn’t have the scale. Amazon.com can therefore only survive by cutting out the warehouse altogether and routing orders directly to publishers, who then ship the books directly to customers. This scheme may cause some relative inefficiency in shipping, since books from multiple publishers would no longer be bundled into single packages. But this inefficiency would probably be more than compensated by reduced handling elsewhere along the line. The real structural problem is at the publishers, whose operations are notoriously backward. Publishers, after all, compete primarily on the content of their books, not their speed of delivery. Working for the operational side of a publisher has never been a brilliant career move. Publishers could probably lower their prices by outsourcing their printing, distribution, fulfillment, and other paper- and money-handling activities, but they have only weak incentives to do this. Until the publishers modernize, nothing can change. And the publishers are cornered by Barnes and Noble as well, since in many cases it is their largest customer. So the picture is bleak.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>I recite</dt>
                <dd>this rather conventional analysis because it heightens the mystery of the current bubble in stock prices for Internet companies.</dd>
                <dt>Nobody</dt>
                <dd>really knows what is causing this bubble, but a good candidate is the ideology. If you believe that cyberspace is a separate sphere of life, and that Internet companies live in wholly different categories from non-Internet companies, then you can believe that amazon.com is the wave of the future.</dd>
                <dt>Web-based consumer commerce</dt>
                <dd><p>If you believe that information technology is the magic powder that revolutionizes the industrial system, effectively replacing</p> <p>the existing system with some other system on new principles, then you can believe that any company that positions itself as all-digital will inherit the revolutionary future.</p></dd>
                <dt>electronic commerce</dt>
                <dd>But if you believe, to the contrary, that the Web is simply a new face on an industrial system that evolves by its own rules besides those of bits, then you’ll want to go find out what the rules are.</dd>
                <dt>business-to-business</dt>
                <dd>This focus on surfaces at the expense of contextualizing substance is partly the fault of the press skewing toward stories that directly affect the lives of their audience.</dd>
                <dt>cyberspace</dt>
                <dd>Many people, Langdon Winner for example, have noticed the strange new linguistic mutation whereby “technology” means “high technology,” and “high technology” means “information technology,” and “information technology” means “Internet,” and “Internet” means “Web-based consumer commerce.”</dd>
            </dl>
            <p> is an important story, but the much more important story is , that is to say, the role of information <kbd>by</kbd> technology in mediating interactions of all sorts between businesses.</p>
            <p>One way to <q>understand</q> business-to-business electronic commerce is that digital networking, and in practice this is ever-more-clearly coming to mean <s>the Internet,</s> is being used to mediate transactions on higher and higher ontological levels. Telephone and fax operate at low ontological levels<span class="emdash"></span>they transmit only very unstructured data, and high levels of human intervention are <var>required</var> at each end to make use of it. <em>Advanced supply chain integration, contrast, connects computers that share overlapping data models.</em> As a result, much <abbr>greater quantities</abbr> of information can be usefully exchanged. This may not sound like a difficult accomplishment, but in practice when it works it is something of a miracle. The hard <code>question, and the one that the stock</code> <mark>faddists</mark> do not seem sufficiently attuned to, is what structural effects <i>flow from</i> the pervasive <b>Internet-enabled</b> integration of supply chains throughout the industrial system? <strong>Those effects probably</strong> cannot be <u>generalized about; in the short and medium terms they will depend</u> on the relative rates at <samp>which</samp> the arduous work of integration proceeds in different firms and industries, and in the long term its structural outcomes may well be path-dependent. <dfn>Precisely because</dfn> every publisher has a monopoly over its own titles, publishing is just about the last <cite>industry where</cite> one should expect to see energetic effort or massive structural changes along these lines. Radical Republicans have been piercing <a title="What?" href="#">the liberal media</a> blackout over the last few days to assert that the Senate can convict an impeached President without necessarily turning him out of office. The strategy here is clear enough, an attempted repeat of the dumbing-down of the standard for impeachment that was successfully executed in the House. The problem, of course, is that their new assertions straightforwardly conflict with the Constitution.</p>
            <p>Now that the Republican assault on the rule of law has reached its nadir, it’s time for normal Americans to figure out what’s going on. One clue can be found in the suggestion by the theocratic intellectual Richard John Neuhaus, that turning Bill Clinton out of office would serve as an emetic for the country. It was interesting to watch the different media outlets’ treatment of this word. Some assumed that their readers knew what it meant, others defined it without making any special deal out of it, and others made a point of sending readers to their dictionaries. It’s a Greek word, and it means “an agent that induces vomiting.” You’re not imagining it, in other words: they really are trying to make you throw up.</p>
            <p>But why? I have a theory. Not that you’d know it from listening to sermons, but Jesus, in the New Testament, spends much if not most of his time casting out demons from afflicted souls. Furthermore, scriptural evidence makes it clear that Jesus gave authority to His believers to cast out demons as well. And that’s what I think the Radical Republicans believe they’re doing<span class="emdash"></span>casting out Satan from America’s soul. In their minds, the House managers<span class="emdash"></span>a man who compares himself to Jesus, together with his twelve followers<span class="emdash"></span>are engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the ultimate liar. They didn’t make this idea up themselves. The idea that America has become possessed by Satan is central to their whole worldview. And in recent years a subculture has grown of evangelical Christians who are trying to cast out demons according to Biblical instructions<span class="emdash"></span>see, for example, Neil T. Anderson, The Bondage Breakers, Harvest House, 1990. The basic method for casting out a demon is to confront the demon and order it, in God’s name, to go away. This will work, the Bible says, so long as everyone involved, including both the afflicted individual and the people doing the casting, maintain an absolute faith in God. Absolute faith being difficult to achieve, however, the demons can be expected to resist, and this resistance typically takes the form of attempts to induce doubt, whether through fear or lies or sophistry. You have to assume that the demon, being essentially a manifestation of Satan, has greater physical strength than you do, and greater powers of reason. And so the demon wins as soon as you attempt to defeat it by violence or argument. You defeat the demon solely by invoking the truths of Christian religion, and most particularly by asserting that the universe is, at its most fundamental level, ruled not by Satan or his followers but by a force of infinite goodness upon whose side you yourself stand.</p>
            <p>Casting out demons can be dangerous. Done badly, it can cause immense destruction by stirring up all kinds of unconscious junk. The demons are mobile, and can easily lodge themselves in anybody who lets them in, including the people who confront them. Or they can deepen their existing grip by exacerbating the existing doubt and despair. It is a particularly bad idea to attempt to cast out demons from somebody who does not want them cast out, say for example because they do not believe that they are afflicted with demons. And that, it seems to me, is what’s happening in the present case. The Radical Republicans are, right now, subjecting the country to an involuntary exorcism. They are taking an enormous risk, and have been for several years. If you listen to them, they keep saying that if they just go one step further, one step further, one step further, then Americans will wake up and realize that they are afflicted with spiritual malaise, and that they will rise up in disgust and cast off the liar and his lying ways. And yet at each step this fails to happen.</p>
            <p>So now we have come to a perilous situation. We are in the middle of a very powerful, very dangerous ritual that is going badly astray. The people do not believe that they are afflicted by a demon, and they do not want any exorcisms to be performed on them. But an exorcism is in fact under way, and the would-be exorcists are interpreting everything they see and hear as if it were the writhings of Satan. If it is pointed out that they are making charges for which they have absolutely no evidence, they hear Satan’s diabolical use of logic.</p>
            <p>If it is pointed out that no ordinary citizen would ever be indicted, much less convicted, on the facts they have brought forward, they hear Satan’s diabolical use of “legalism.” If it is pointed out that they have been running roughshod over every civilized norm of due process, they hear Satan’s diabolical attempts to instill the doubting thought that maybe they are the real evil ones. Steadfast, however, they carry on, weathering Satan’s overwhelming displays of reason and law. Surely, they say, surely, if we just press forward, if we just pursue this process and keep on ordering the demon to flee, then eventually our patient will see that, looked at in the right way, underneath the surface of slick evasions, all of these seemingly innocent details can be seen as manifestations of the Plot.</p>
            <p>The problem here is not with God, or with faith in God. The problem is not with the idea of demons, or even with the idea of casting them out. The problem is with a group of arrogant and irresponsible men<span class="emdash"></span>men who are just wrong. These men are not casting out any demons: quite the contrary, they are inviting demons into themselves. They are learning, and teaching everyone who will listen to them, how to reject logic, how to twist evidence, how to inflate the use of words beyond any normal sense of proportion, how to accuse people of doing the very things they are doing themselves, and how to undermine the rule of law while claiming under the authority of God that they are doing the opposite. By systematically identifying reason and law as the diabolical trickery of Satan, they are cultivating and instilling habits of mind that are deeply irrational. They are destroying the country’s political institutions. They are destroying the country. Operating systems have been getting steadily worse for forty years. A whole generation has grown up without even being able to conceive the concept, much less the benefits, of preemptive multitasking. Being a dissident from personal computers, I do most of my computing by telnetting from my Mac to a Unix machine, where I run the ascii text editor Emacs, a freeware product of the Free Software Foundation. Among its innumerable virtues, Emacs upholds a deceptively simple principle which it calls the priority of input over output. Emacs is organized as a number of different processes, so that the process that reads and executes your keyboard commands is unlinked from the process that updates the screen. If you’re typing on the keyboard, then the screen stops refreshing until your commands have been read and their effects have been applied to an internal representation of your text. Once that process is satisfied, then the screen refreshing process resumes its work. The point of this distinction is that you never drop keystrokes<span class="emdash"></span>no matter how fast you type, everything you type gets reflected in your file and on your screen eventually. If you don’t like the redisplay process falling behind, stop typing until it catches up.</p>
            <p>This scheme, which was already considered obvious twenty years ago, is an absurd improvement on the behavior of the Macintosh and Windows, neither of which assigns any particular priority to listening to what the user has to say. If these machines are busy then they’re busy and you can just wait. If they’re opening a connection to some overloaded Web server in Prague or some overloaded mail server on another floor, then you can just go get a nice cup of coffee since you won’t even be able to select a different window, much less click on any buttons or select any menu items while your machine is waiting for the server to respond. Do you want to download a huge, complicated Web page onto one window in the background while you do useful work with a quick response time on some other window? Well forget it. Is this pathetic? How does anybody get anything done? We’re all pretending that this stuff works because we’ve been persuaded that it’s the future. In fact it’s the past, and getting more so. This is the real reason why swing is back: at our present rate of devolution, slide rules will be back soon too.</p>
            <p>Recommended: Harvey Sacks, Lectures on Conversation, edited by Gail Jefferson, Blackwell, 1995. Harvey Sacks was the founder of a strange subfield of sociology called conversation analysis, which consists of the microscopic study of ordinary conversations. Sacks discovered that even quite mundane conversations are extraordinarily complicated in their inner workings, and this book gathers his lectures on the subject from the mid-1970’s, up until his accidental death in an auto accident in 1974. He discusses the elaborate protocols by which people start and end conversations, announce and tell stories, refer to things, and generally keep the conversational gears turning. His theories are always based on detailed analyses of particular examples of conversation, which are presented using a notation invented by Gail Jefferson. Jefferson started out as Sacks’ secretary; Sacks, at the beginning of his studies, asked her to transcribe some conversations without realizing the full complexity of the task, and the notation that Jefferson developed to indicate the features of conversational interaction that can have functional significance (pauses, overlaps, emphases, and so on) was eventually adopted by the entire field that Sacks began. Jefferson also edited the lectures for publication. They’re lectures, not finished papers, and they’re not particularly polished lectures either. You have to hang in there a little while before you understand what he’s doing, and how, and why. You also have to let go of preconceived ideas about sociological methodology, especially if you were trained in quantitative methods. Sacks’ work is totally qualitative, and his theories are intended to apply to every single example of naturally occurring conversation in the world. Sacks’ methods also take getting used to if you’ve been trained in the kind of structuralist linguistics that is identified with Chomsky. Sacks was not interested in specifying a grammar of well-formed conversations, from which real conversations may diverge. Yet, on the other hand, neither is he claiming to reconstruct the conscious intentions of the speakers; rather, he claims to specify a set of rules and preferences that suffice to reconstruct particular examples of what people do in conversation, that is, what social actions they are engaged in. Although not discernably political in his language or intent, Sacks was recognizably of his time. By defamiliarizing the ordinary world, he was engaged in the same sort of ontological rebellion as many more flamboyant, less substantive countercultural types. He wanted to show that ordinary reality has depths, and that it is stranger, more complicated, and more fragile than it seems. Above all he wanted to demonstrate that ordinary reality, far from being a fixed structure or an externally imposed force, is something that we assent to<span class="emdash"></span>indeed, that we actively and skillfully create<span class="emdash"></span>in our every waking moment. Did he mean to imply that we should turn around and recreate our ordinary reality in some different way? He left no particular evidence one way or the other. On the one hand, a real understanding of Sacks’ discoveries<span class="emdash"></span>not just grasping them theoretically, but actually being able to see the phenomena happening in your own interactions with others<span class="emdash"></span>should help deepen the responsibility that you feel for your own actions, and for your own contribution to whatever is good or bad in the social phenomena that you participate in. On the other hand, really seeing those phenomena should also give you a heightened appreciation for the complexity of social life as we know it, and the magnitude of the hubris involved in the utopian scenarios that would replace it. That’s a healthy tension, I think, and one we should all cultivate. Before we turn our attention fully to the new year, it is important that we stomp the most overrated movies of 1998. All of them, as it happens, pertain to recurring themes of this list.</p>
            <p>Let us begin with “The Truman Show.” People keep acting as if this movie makes some great statement about privacy, and since I’ve written about privacy, people keep telling me that this movie must be deeply relevant to my concerns. I’m mystified. What, exactly, is the point of “The Truman Show?” Is Truman supposed to be a symbol of our lives today? Or are the people who watch him supposed to symbolize us? Is some statement being made about the media, and if so what exactly is it? In the old days, actors and directors proved that they were serious by doing Shakespeare. Nowadays, it seems, they have to make these expensive movies for which a dark emotional tone substitutes for any clearly defined message<span class="emdash"></span>the dark tone is in itself, somehow, the message. I thought that “The Truman Show” was, like “Enemy of the State” and many other Hollywood movies, perfectly entertaining if you keep your brain turned off the whole time. Having been prepared for a Serious Message Movie, however, I misguidedly left my brain turned on for part of it, and I was particularly annoyed by its analysis of television. Television is not moving toward extremely expensive programs like the one in “The Truman Show.” Quite the contrary, as channels proliferate, large audiences are no longer guaranteed by the scarcity of programming. As a result, only a very few programs can assemble audiences large enough to pay for multi-million-dollar-per- episode production budgets. The trend, quite the contrary, with more channels chasing the same audience, is toward programs like “World’s Scariest Car Chases” that can be produced cheaply in large numbers. Next let us consider the mysteriously celebrated “Pi.” Even though the critics apparently regarded it as wildly inventive, in fact, except for the psychotic “Eraserhead” vibe, its whole boring tale about a misanthrophic mathematical prodigy and a computer that prints out a number that encodes the secret of God before exploding could have been made word-for-word in 1956. I’m particular sensitive to this stuff from having gone to graduate school at the MIT AI Lab, where I stewed in every last cliche about intelligent computers. In that context, “Pi” is hardly an innovation. The guy who supervised my master’s thesis, for example, wanted nothing more than to have his mind downloaded into a computer that was mounted on a large telescope that could be launched into space. He figured that if the clock on the computer was turned down really slow then he could float around and watch galaxies evolve. This was not considered a strange thing to want.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is with a heavy heart that I must denounce the critics’ current favorite, Paul Schrader’s “Affliction.” Nick Nolte will indeed win a prize for the extraordinary effort that he obviously put into his portrayal of a man collapsing under the weight of his father’s demons. Unfortunately that prize will have to be “Best Actor in an Otherwise Misguided Film.” Well, not quite<span class="emdash"></span>a couple of the supporting actors are pretty good, as is the cinematography. The real problem is Paul Schrader, who wanted so badly to make a film out of Russell Banks’ novel that he didn’t consider that perhaps it cannot be done. Schrader’s screenplay runs afoul of the most common problem of screenplay adaptations of novels: a novel can engage in all kinds of complicated exposition that, in a film, must be accomplished through dialogue. As a result, the characters in “Affliction” are constantly engaged in artificial and cumbersome interactions whose purpose is obviously to inform the audience of matters that real people would not have needed to mention. As a result, only intermittently did I get involved in the movie, rather than being painfully aware that I was at the movies, sitting in a chair, looking at a screen, lamenting a lousy screenplay, composing my caustic review of it, and so on. The effect is frequently strange: here is Nick Nolte, delivering this superhuman performance, except that there’s no real movie there to contain it. Other actors are present on the set, but it’s like he’s shadowboxing. Oh well. So forget about “Affliction.” Instead, go out to the video store and rent a copy of Alan Rudolph’s “Afterglow,” where you’ll get not only Nick Nolte but an amazing performance by Julie Christie.</p>
